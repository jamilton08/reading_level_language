    "Reading level are very measurable for a neural network, and a neural network does it effectively as well. The grades that were predicted wrong were still within their range for the most part according to the Lexile Text Standards. With a larger training dataset, this will surely be more effectly at distinguighing reading levels. 70% to 90% accuracy is the sweet spot for a model to perform in the real word and with a small sample, this did well.
